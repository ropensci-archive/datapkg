## Data Package in R

[![Project Status: Inactive â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)

Data-packages is a [standard format](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) for describing meta-data for a collection of datasets. The package `datapkg` provides convenience functions for retrieving and parsing data packages in R. To install in R:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("hadley/readr")
install_github("ropenscilabs/jsonvalidate")
install_github("ropenscilabs/datapkg")
```

## Reading data

The `datapkg_read` function retrieves and parses data packages from a local or remote sources. A few example packages are available from the [datasets](https://github.com/datasets) and [testsuite-py](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/testsuite-py) repositories. The path needs to point to a directory on disk or git remote or URL containing the root of the data package.

```r
# Load client
library(datapkg)

# Clone via git
cities <- datapkg_read("git://github.com/datasets/world-cities")

# Same data but download over http
cities <- datapkg_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/world-cities/master")
```

The output object contains data and metadata from the data-package, with actual datasets inside the `$data` field.

```r
# Package info
print(cities)

# Open actual data in RStudio Viewer
View(cities$data[[1]])
```

In the case of multiple datasets, each one is either referenced by index or, if available, by name (names are optional in data packages).

```r
# Package with many datasets
euribor <- datapkg_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/euribor/master")

# List datasets in this package
names(euribor$data)
View(euribor$data[[1]])
```

## Writing data

The package also has basic functionality to save a data frame into a data package and 
update the `datapackage.json` file accordingly.

```r
# Create new data package
pkgdir <- tempfile()
datapkg_write(mtcars, path = pkgdir)
datapkg_write(iris, path = pkgdir)

# Read it back
mypkg <- datapkg_read(pkgdir)
print(mypkg$data$mtcars)
```

From here you can modify the `datapackage.json` file with other metadata.

## Status

This package is work in progress. Current open issues:

 - Make `readr` parse `0`/`1` values for booleans: [PR#406](https://github.com/hadley/readr/pull/406)
 - Support "year only" dates (`%Y`). Not sure if this constituates a valid date actually: [PR#407](https://github.com/hadley/readr/pull/407)
 - R and `readr` require to specify which strings are interepreted as missing values. Default are empty string `""` and `NA`. A similar property needs to be defined in the spec.
 - It is unclear what to do with parsing errors, or if the fields in `datapackage.json` does not match the csv data. Examples: [s-and-p-500](https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500) and [currency-codes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frictionlessdata/testsuite-py/master/datasets/currency-codes)

Features:

 - Writing data packages from data frames.
